# How to Contribute

Contributions take many forms from submitting issues, writing docs, to making
code changes - we welcome it all!

## Getting Started

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can [sign up](https://github.com/signup/free)
as it will help you to participate with the project. After signing up, please ensure
you create/export a Personal Access Token (PAT) or an SSH key to authenticate to GitHub.

If you are running GitHub Desktop, you can clone this repository locally from
GitHub using the "Clone in Desktop" button from the project page,
or run this command in your Git-enabled shell:

`git clone git@github.com:kfcampbell-demo-open-source-101/my-first-contribution.git`
(if using an SSH key) or `git clone https://github.com/kfcampbell-demo-open-source-101/my-first-contribution.git`
(if using HTTPS).

If you want to make contributions to the project,
[forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) is the
easiest way to do this. You can then clone down your fork instead:

`git clone https://github.com/MY-USERNAME-HERE/my-first-contribution.git`.

## Making Changes and Submitting a Pull Request

Once you've edited your changes, add the relevant files/folders with `git add filename(s)`.
Then commit with `git commit -m "Your reasonable commit message"` and push them
to your fork with `git push`.

You may then visit your fork's repository and create a pull request to the
upstream repo.
